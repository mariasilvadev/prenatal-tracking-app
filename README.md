# prenatal-tracking-app

Use this app to keep track of your prenatal appointments, learn how big your baby is, and what you can expect at each visit.

Check off your appointments as you progress through your pregnancy and learn how big your baby is with emojis. Click on each visit to read what you can expect from assessments, labs, or procedures and why they are important to you and the health of your baby. The app also allows you to add any additional visits and check them off.
